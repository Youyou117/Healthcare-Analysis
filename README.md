### Topic: Analyzing Cardiovascular Disease to Minimize Mortality and Economic Impact

### Deal with the Data
### 1. Within Canadian adults (20-64 years of age), is having osteoarthritis associated with developing heart disease?
For the purpose of this case study, assume that, from the literature, we know that the following variables are risk factors for the outcome and confounders in the above relationship: age, sex, ethnicity, education, household income, body mass index (BMI), access to a regular medical doctor, smoking habit, alcohol drinking habit, high-blood pressure, and diabetes. Also, assume that physical activity is suspected to be an intermediate factor between osteoarthritis and heart

### 2. Does the relationship between osteoarthritis and heart disease vary:
a. between participants living in the northern parts of Canada versus those living in the southern parts
b. between men and women
c. by marital status
d. by recency of immigration

### 3. Bonus Question: 
###### Do the results change when missing values (i.e., invalid responses) for the ‘household income’ are imputed? 
Which assumptions do you have to make to perform such an analysis?

### Analyze in terms of Economic impact
1. What is the economic impact of cardiovascular disease in Canada?
2. What are the most realistic approaches to minimizing the economic impact of cardiovascular disease in Canada?
3. How does the fixed and variable cost of dealing with cardiovascular diseases look like? Has it increased over the years?
4. What are some of the KPIs that can be identified through the dataset to measure the economic
